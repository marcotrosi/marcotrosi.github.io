         <b>alternative-rock</b> This is my first band. My best friends Alexander Cee and Stefan Wehner founded a band in 1994, which
         I joined one year later. Singers, bass players and the band name changed a couple of times until we met Till
         Krause and Michael Kerth in 1998. We wrote and recorded songs and played gigs all over Germany. Definitely the
         best time of my life.

         <b>pop-soul</b> What started years ago as a singer-songwriter duo is now a nice pop-soul band with 4 members. In this
         band I mostly play the guitar and sometimes a stage piano. The style I‘m playing here is completely different to
         what I‘ve done before.

         <b>indie-pop</b> This was a very nice project which I did together with Till Krause the former singer of <i>phonetics</i>
         in 2005. It was really fun and I learned so much at this time. Knowing we would never play our songs
         live on stage, we decided to give our album „Silence, a great luxury“ away for free.

         <b>alternative-rock</b> Basically the members of <i>phonetics</i> but without Till Krause. The style slightly changed.
